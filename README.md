# 3D Gomoku

## Prerequisites
Node.js and its package manager, NPM, are required to run this application.

## Installation
To be run inside this repository:
```
npm i
node_modules/.bin/webpack
npm start
```
After running the last command, the application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Overview

* `server.js` - a simple development server that serves the static/ dir on localhost:3000
* `static/assets/board.{mtl,obj}` - board model object file - needs to be broken
  down into separate black and white tile models, so that the board can be
  dynamically resized (e.g. 3x3, 9x9 variants)
* `static/assets/*Texture.jpg` - textures used in the board model
* `static/assets/{left,right,search}.png` - icons exported from Font Awesome
* `static/index.css` - application stylesheet
* `static/bundle.js` - JS bundle generated by Webpack
* `static/*.{css,js}` - the rest are assets copied over from node\_modules so
  that the application is executable even without installing all node\_modules
* `src/note.ts`, `src/sequence.ts` - WebAudio components, a sigle note and a
  sequence of them
* `src/types.ts` - some TypeScript interfaces and enums used in the rest of the code
* `src/index.tsx` - application entrypoint
* `src/components/App.tsx` - main React component, contains state from
  pages, handles switching between them
* `src/components/{Help,Home,MultiPlayer,SinglePlayer,Settings}.tsx` -
  individual application pages
* `src/components/Board.tsx` - the point of Three.js interaction. Right now, it
  just displays a #container and runs the Three.js application defined in
  Board.componentDidMount. It also contains inline code of OrbitControls, as at
  the time I was writing this page, I didn't know how to include individual
  Three.js modules.

## Tasks
* break the board model down into individual tiles - in the end, we don't have
  to use the .obj and .mtl files, they were just the easiest way to do this at
  that time, we can directly use Three.js objects and simply map the textures
  over them
* create X and O models - they can be exported from the .blend file where I
  modeled the prototype into .obj and .mtl files, I think
* create logic that maps an internal state (represented as a sequence of moves?)
  to board state, and link back and forward buttons to this logic
* find a way to map clicks to individual tile object, and implement 'onclick'
  logic - we might need to tap into the OrbitControls code, as they handle
  'onmousedown' and 'onmouseup', I'm not sure.
* remove 'Back' button from the Board page, and implement a menu (with settings,
  forfeit btn, what else?)
